    <ul>
        <li>200g <b>self-raising flour</b> <i>(or plain flour with 3 tsp baking powder)</i></li>
        <li>1 tsp <b>bicarbonate of soda</b> <i>(baking soda)</i></li>
        <li>1 <b>pinch salt</b></li>
        <li>1 tbsp <b>caster sugar</b></li>
        <li>2 <b>large eggs</b> <i>(beaten)</i></li>
        <li>300ml <b>buttermilk</b> <i>(or regular milk)</i></li>
        <li>25g <b>butter</b> <i>(melted, plus extra for frying)</i></li>
        <li><b>Toppings of your choice</b> <i>(e.g., maple syrup, berries, chocolate chips)</i></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift 200g self-raising flour, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, a pinch of salt, and 1 tbsp caster sugar into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 beaten large eggs and 300ml buttermilk.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients along with 25g melted butter.</li>
        <li>Whisk lightly until just combined. Don't worry if there are a few lumps â€“ over-mixing makes tough pancakes!</li>
        <li>Heat a knob of butter or a drizzle of oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Pour a small ladleful (about 2-3 tbsp) of the batter into the pan for each pancake.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes until bubbles appear on the surface and the underside is golden.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side until golden.</li>
        <li>Stack the cooked pancakes and keep them warm while you cook the rest of the batter.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with toppings of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
